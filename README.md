# lucent
Lucent is a web server written in Rust with some useful features (including CGI/NPH script support, URL rewriting support, dynamically generated directory listings, HTTP basic authentication, and a simple template engine) and an implementation of HTTP/1.1 written from the ground up. The goal of this project wasn't to build a production ready web server, but just to implement a large subset of the HTTP/1.1 spec in order to gain a deeper understanding of its inner workings. Despite this, it's turned out to be usable enough for serving my [website](http://lunarcoffee.cf).
