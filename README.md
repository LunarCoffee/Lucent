Web server with some useful features (including CGI/NPH script support, URL rewriting support, dynamically generated directory listings, and HTTP basic authentication) and an implementation of HTTP/1.1 written from the ground up. The goal of this project was not to create a production ready web server, but to implement a large subset of the HTTP/1.1 specification in order to gain a deeper understanding of its inner workings. In spite of this, it has turned out to be pretty usable and has enough features for a number of common uses, and I am currently using it to host my [personal website](http://lunarcoffee.cf).
